Title:
  - Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe (Inspired By First Chapter Of Ben Orlin's New Book: "Math With Bad Drawings (c)2018".

This Project:
  - While working for a living I really did not have a lot of free time fool around with projects that just interested me:
  - That is changing now (I'm retired).
  - My goal for this GitHub project is document and share not only the content, end-results and also a process that may be followed in general by anyone. 
  - The deeper you drill down, hopefully, the more you learn.
  - The 'end-results' should be apps that anyone can download from various app stores and then enjoy playing.
  - The 'process' should include documentation like this readme file and other documentation describing how the tools are used and why the logic/code was structured as it was.
  - The 'content' should include many, many files of various formats with documentation on how to build/test them.

This Document:
  - Is incomplete. Only the first four items in the version protypev000 section (see below) currently exist.
  - As more is completed this file should be updated to reflect th actual and the proposed
  - Keeping track of all the files was a big motivation to create the GitHub project

Project Versions:
  + PrototypeV000
    - Python Code Using "CodeSkulptor3"
    - A Series Text file named in the format" "USER3012_<some_id_chaacters>_nn.py" 
    - May be used at: https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#<text_file_name>
    - The Prototype displays the prototype GUI using the CodeSkulptor3 "SimpleGUI" library
    - The Prototype implements the game.
    - The Prototype does implement 'the-rule-of-the-ultimate-tic-tac-toe-game'
    - The Prototype does continue until a win or a tie or a new_gam state is reached.
  + PrototypeV001
    - A cloud based app based on Version 0.0 with an eye toward integration with specific devices
  + PrototypeV002
    - A iPad/Android/Mac-App/Win10-App/<other framework>-APP
  + PrototypeV003
    - Integrate the functionalities developed in Versions 0.0, 0.1, 0.2
  + PublishV10
    - Some Apps that capture (for various devices) the functionalities developed and tested in the protype versions above.
  + PrototypeV004
    - An A.I. oponent.
  + PublishV20
    - Updated The Apps so they include the behavior of the A.I. tested opponent prototype.

Motivation (Who I Am):
  + I am an old guy.
  + [70+ YEARS] I am and have been a student, a teacher, a worker in the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, and one other field. (Also I continue as a spouse, and the father of three. And, the friend of those four people. The coolest four people on earth)
  + [YR 2013]  I have been retired for a few years now.
  + [30 YEARS] I was a salaried worker in the computer science industry.
  + [10 YEARS] I was (formally paid as and continue to be an unpaid) student and teacher of mathematics, physics, and computer science
  + [12 YEARS] I additionally (in-the-early-years) worked in the operational side of Meteorology, Oceanography, Hydrology and Data Communications as:
    - An Aerographer's Mate for the US Navy and also as
    - A Meteorological Technician for NOAA.
  + [IN 2013] I am now retired and take great interest as a student and teacher of the above fields by:
    - Following many, many, popular blogs, social media accounts of folk who popularize those fields.
    - I even read (some of) the original research.
    - I also am an avid reader/viewer-listener of popular accounts of the state of the current day and realy good fiction.
  + [THESE DAYS] I do now actively create: 
    - Software (mostly Python) but C-# SWIFT etc...
    - Mathematics (of a very simple sort, riddles, puzzles, (mostly solutions) and other-just-stuff)
  + [AND ONE OTHER FIELD] I create/add-to/learn-about/enjoy/follow/worry-about/celebrate
    - Ideas that explore the design and implementation of "The Mind" as it is embodied by "Living" organisms.
    - Ideas about the concept of "The Mind" from above as they apply to A.I. and G.A.I.
    - NOTE: The guiding principal of the above two items is based on the fact that there is (currently) only one tool available to develop such concepts.  That tool consist of the set of human minds that contemplate such ideas.
    - NOTE: The guiding principle for the use of the tool mentioned above is that the foundations of modern logic and mathematics do dictate when any model reaches a certain level of complexity it will either produce: Paradox (inconsistant) or There will exist true propositions that may never be shown to be true (consistent).
